# Module 16 Challenge: Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview

The task for this project is to analyze Amazon Reviews written by both paid (via Amazon Vine Program) and unpaid customers to determine if there is a bias towards favorable reviews published by paid Vine members. The product dataset type I selected for my analysis was watches.

The specific steps to complete this project are as follows: use PySpark to perform the ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, and load the transformed data into pgAdmin, use PySpark, Pandas, or SQL to determine if there is any bias.
